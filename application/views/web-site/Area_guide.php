                                Napoleon once stated, “if earth was a single state, then Istanbul would be its capital.“
                                For those who have visited or lived in Istanbul, Napoleon’s words ring even truer today.
                                Positioned on the European and Asian continents, Istanbul is divided by the famous,
                                romantic, and sometimes tragic Bosphorus Strait, hence the reason many novelists have
                                spent their time within the city walls to draw their inspiration.
                                <br> <br>

                                Now, on to the geographics of this often-times misunderstood community. On each side
                                lies sprawling and historic neighborhoods, boasting bazaars, historical sites, watering
                                holes, and most importantly, 20 million residents that call Istanbul home. Due to the
                                massive population explosion of the late 1910’s and early 2000’s, Istanbul is currently
                                experiencing massive regeneration to upgrade the homes that were quite literally thrown
                                together to support the cities rising numbers. Rather it be the historic areas of Sisli,
                                Kadikoy, Umraniye, Beyoglu, or Zeytinburnu, transformation is taking place at breakneck
                                speed. This is much to the delight of the long-time Istanbulites who are tired of the
                                over-crowding and lack of space for their leisure time.

                                Istanbul is one of the worlds largest metropolitan areas. Made up of 27 urban districts,
                                they are split between Asia and Europe. On the European side there is Avcılar, Bağcılar,
                                Bahçelievler, Bakırköy, Bayrampaşa, Beşiktaş, Beyoğlu, Eminönü, Esenler, Eyüp, Fatih,
                                Gaziosmanpaşa, Güngören, Kağithane, Küçükçekmece, Sarıyer, Şişli, and Zeytinburnu.

                                Here at <b>Prime Property Turkey</b>, we focus on areas that have a few key indicators
                                to a successful investment.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>1. Supply vs Demand – </b>There is a reason this is one of the first economics
                                principles
                                taught in universities across the world. However, we take this one step further. We
                                focus on your goals and initiatives. If you have a 15- year exit strategy, then maybe an
                                oversupplied new regeneration is exactly the item you are looking for so we can
                                capitalize on your exit. Understanding your goals are key to us providing the best
                                property with the prime result.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>2. Annual ROI vs Capital Growth</b>, which one is more important? Well, that depends
                                on each
                                individual situation. While some need more to their immediate bottom line, others choose
                                to draw median returns in hopes of capturing greater capital gains.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>3. Is this a purchase for</b> lifestyle, holiday, or purely investment? These three
                                different types of buyer’s dictate our strategy and advisement. At Prime Property
                                Turkey, we believe each and every buyer is different in their own right, and thus should
                                have a customized and tailored plan of attack to suit their needs.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>4. Risk vs Reward….</b> This is oftentimes misunderstood, as property leaves you with
                                fewer
                                risks compared to the latest short stock or international equity. However, there are
                                certain opportunities in the market where more risk is involved. We perceive these risks
                                as under development properties that can be bough at grassroots prices, yet are a year
                                or more away from delivery. The risks are obvious, but history has shown that gains of
                                up to 40% are possible by the time the project is completed. While this option isn’t for
                                everyone, it is a legitimate option depending on the clients needs.
                                <br><br>
                                Now that we have touched on Istanbul, the geography, and our principles, let us take a
                                look at some areas and how we categorize them. Many agencies may claim certain areas to
                                be zones of 1, 2, and 3. While very basic, they are categorizing their importance of
                                each zone, with 3 being the lowest. At Prime Property Turkey, we categorize each zone by
                                what it offers, rather than how much money we stand to make. A keen investor would catch
                                such remarks, but the “market insiders“ cover their tracks quite well.

                                </u>
                            </div>
                            <p class="px-4 pt-1 text-justify">
                                Western side of Istanbul. This includes the neighborhoods of Avcilar, Beylikduzu,
                                Buyukcekmece, Esenyurt, Basaksehir, and Kucukcekmece. This area we categorize simply as
                                the “West-Side.“ These areas offer options suitable for holiday, lifestyle, and
                                investment. However, it does go back to our key indicators to how it best fits your
                                goals. An immediate look at the inventory will tell you that there is somewhat of an
                                oversupply of properties. What if fails to tell you, is that is one of the most heavily
                                invested areas in Turkey. Why? Price….Simply put, properties can be purchased here at
                                fractions of options in other parts of Istanbul. When we discuss strategy and
                                investment, this area offers yields on par with most other areas of Istanbul, but growth
                                will be at a slower rate. That’s not to say some major infrastructural changes cannot
                                bring about immediate change, but this is an area where we should focus for a long-term
                                exit.
                                <br><br>
                                With that being said, tremendous options at below average prices can be had here. Those
                                looking for an investment with some lifestyle attributes behind the purchase, tend to
                                buy in this area.
                                <br><br>
                                What are the demographics of this area? In areas around the marina and coastlines, you
                                have some of the wealthiest Turkish and international population within Istanbul. The
                                inner parts are highly urban with a diverse mix of immigrants from the Middle East and
                                South East Asia to go along with the dominant Turkish population. Many industries
                                relating to food, textile, and manufacturing are here.

                                Central Istanbul is comprised of the following neighborhoods: Bakirkoy, Bagcilar,
                                Beyoglu, Eyup, Fatih, Kadikoy, Maslak, Sisli, Uskudar, Umraniye, and Zeytinburnu.
                                <br><br>
                                While this ranges from the Golden Coast of Zeytinburnu to the bustling streets of Bagdat
                                Avenue in Kadikoy, Central Istanbul has become more accessible with the recent
                                connections of the Istanbul Metro System. The furthest corners of Kadikoy and Bakirkoy
                                can now reach Yenikapi within 20 minutes by metro. How has this impacted the market? It
                                has allowed residents who once were limited to only very central areas to move to the
                                surrounding areas, improving their quality of life and offering a more comfortable
                                lifestyle for their families. We love this area for those seeking a lifestyle and
                                investment purchase in Istanbul.
                                <br><br>
                                Why is this area good for investment? As we mentioned earlier, Istanbul went from around
                                3M residents in the 1960’s to around 20 million by 2020. Housing was quickly erected to
                                accommodate the growing numbers. With judicial reforms and safety inspections being
                                conducted in recent years, these areas are experiencing mass regeneration. These new
                                developments offer low prices for otherwise highly-priced properties due to most home
                                owners having lived in the area for at least 10 years or more. Easy access to services,
                                schools, and hospitals continues to drive prices in the area. Additionally, as traffic
                                continues to wreak havoc on residents, more and more are looking to set up in easily
                                commutable areas. These areas have to many positives to list.
                                <br><br>
                                To conclude, we should note that entry level prices are higher than in other areas, and
                                this is particularly true with luxury-high-rise buildings in this location as branding
                                and luxury is delivered to the highest level. While some investors may be put off by the
                                base level price, this is a fantastic location for those looking for a hands-off
                                approach to investing. Nightly, weekly, and monthly opportunities present themselves in
                                this area for those looking to capture a piece of the tourism pie.

                                Demographics? Typically, this area boasts a younger and educated population. The locals
                                of the area usually work in white-collar positions allowing them to have the expendable
                                income to purchase such properties. However, certain areas of Beyoglu, Fatih, Kadikoy,
                                Sisli, and Uskudar have large swaths of low-income areas. This is mainly due to lack of
                                planning’s for new developments being allowed in these areas, plus these areas are near
                                the service industry sectors that support Istanbul’s millions of visitors annually.
                                However, we do expect this to change in the coming years as the municipality government
                                looks to “clean“ up the area and instill a new version of Istanbul. Many in local
                                government wish to see the restoration and recreation of Istanbul in a modern form. We
                                are getting there, which is why foreign investment continues to rise. History is being
                                written in front of us. Where do you want to be when the story is written?

                                Often an unknown and scary area for foreigners and tourists alike. As the American
                                expression goes, “you are often afraid of what you don’t know.“ This is very true for
                                the Eastern part of Istanbul. This area has some of the cleanest and most
                                family-oriented coastline neighborhood’s in Istanbul. Yet many foreigners have never
                                ventured as far to find out for themselves. Though this is slowly starting to change, it
                                is still a very “Turkish“ area.
                                <br><br>
                                Eastern Istanbul is comprised of Beykoz, Dragos, Kartal, Pendik, and Tuzla. While
                                oftentimes not familiar with folks from outside of the region, Tuzla and Pendik is
                                slowly tabbing itself as the “Silicon Valley“ of Turkey. Many international Middle East,
                                Eastern Europe, and Africa IT companies are establishing themselves here due to Turkey’s
                                huge numbers of qualified software/network/structural engineers. Where there comes
                                potential, there comes reward, and this area is no different.
                                <br><br>
                                This area boasts very-low entry level prices and large units compared to more central
                                parts of the city. The neighborhoods tend to have been planned in accordance with
                                up-to-date laws and prudence. Meaning, less regeneration is taking place here. How is
                                this to your benefit? Well in the short-term, it honestly is not. However, as the
                                technology sectors and natural appreciation occur, 5-8 years down the road lends itself
                                to significant gains in rental returns, but also capital growth.
                                <br><br>
                                We do want to take a special mention for our clients and say that this is a very
                                “under-the-radar“ type area. This has the potential long-term be a very significant
                                investment; however, patience is key. We love this for lifestyle purchases and those
                                looking to capitalize on low prices and large units. This is a expectation vs reality
                                investment. Know what to expect and know what to earn. If you understand and appreciate
                                those factors, this will be a very fruitful investment.
                                <br><br>
                                What are the demographics of the area? The areas is comprised of around 40% with a
                                Bachelors degree or higher. Many jobs related to the IT industry lie here. In addition,
                                this area is a hub of logistics and manufacturing as international and domestic
                                transport are key in these areas. The area is rapidly becoming more sophisticated as
                                more and more industry enter the market in these regions. Should you want to be waging
                                an investment on long-term growth, we can think of no better place.
