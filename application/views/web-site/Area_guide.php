                                Napoleon once stated, <b>“if earth was a single state, then Istanbul would be its
                                    capital.”</b> Napoleon’s words ring even truer today for those who have visited or
                                lived in
                                Istanbul. Positioned on the European and Asian continents, Istanbul is divided by the
                                famous, romantic, and sometimes tragic Bosphorus Strait, hence why many novelists have
                                spent their time within the city walls to draw inspiration.

                                Now, on to the geographics of this often-times misunderstood community. On each side lie
                                sprawling and historic neighborhoods, boasting bazaars, historical sites, watering
                                holes, and most importantly, 20 million residents that call Istanbul home.

                                Due to the massive population explosion of the late 1910s and early 2000s, Istanbul is
                                currently experiencing massive regeneration to upgrade the homes thrown together to
                                support the city’s rising numbers.

                                transformation is taking place at breakneck speed. This is much to the delight of the
                                long-time Istanbulites who are tired of the overcrowding and lack of space for their
                                leisure time.

                                principles
                                taught in universities across the world. However, we take this one step further. We
                                focus on your goals and initiatives. If you have a 15- year exit strategy, then maybe an
                                oversupplied new regeneration is precisely what you are looking for. Understanding your
                                goals is key to us providing the best property with the prime result.

                                <b>2. Annual ROI vs. Capital Growth</b>, which one is more important? Well, that depends
                                on
                                each situation. While some need more for their immediate bottom line, others choose to
                                draw median returns in hopes of capturing more significant capital gains.

                                different
                                types of buyers dictate our strategy and advisement. At Prime Property Turkey, we
                                believe every buyer is different in their own right and thus should have a customized
                                and tailored plan of attack to suit their needs.
                            </p>

                                <b>4. Risk vs. Reward….</b> This is frequently misunderstood, as property leaves you
                                with fewer
                                risks than the latest short stock or international equity. However, there are specific
                                opportunities in the market where more risk is involved. We perceive these risks as
                                under-development properties that can be bought at grassroots prices yet are a year or
                                more away from delivery.

                                The risks are obvious, but history has shown that gains of up to 40% are possible when
                                the project is completed. While this option isn’t for everyone, it is a legitimate
                                option depending on the client’s needs.

                                Now that we have touched on Istanbul, the geography, and our principles, let us look at
                                some areas and how we categorize them. Many agencies may claim certain areas to be zones
                                1, 2, and 3. While very basic, they categorize the importance of each zone, with three
                                being the lowest.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                At Prime Property Turkey, we categorize each zone by what it offers rather than how much
                                money we stand to make. A keen investor would catch such remarks, but the “market
                                insiders“ cover their tracks quite well.

                                Basaksehir, and Kucukcekmece. This area we categorize simply as the <b>“West Side.”</b>
                                These
                                areas offer options suitable for holidays, lifestyle, and investment. However, it goes
                                back to our critical indicators to how it best fits your goals.

                                A quick look at the inventory will tell you that there is somewhat of an oversupply of
                                properties. What it fails to tell you is that it is one of the most heavily invested
                                areas in Turkey. Why? Price….

                                Properties can be purchased here at fractions than in other parts of Istanbul. When
                                discussing strategy and investment, this area offers yields on par with most other areas
                                of Istanbul, but growth will be slower. That’s not to say some significant
                                infrastructural changes cannot bring about immediate change, but this is an area where
                                we should focus for a long-term exit.

                                That said, excellent options at below-average prices can be had here. Those looking for
                                an investment with some lifestyle attributes behind the purchase tend to buy in this
                                area.

                                While this ranges from the Golden Coast of Zeytinburnu to the bustling streets of Bagdat
                                Avenue in Kadikoy, Central Istanbul has become more accessible with the recent
                                connections of the Istanbul Metro System.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                The furthest corners of Kadikoy and Bakirkoy can now reach Yenikapi within 20 minutes by
                                metro. How has this impacted the market? It has allowed residents who once were limited
                                to only very central areas to move to the surrounding areas, improving their quality of
                                life and offering a more comfortable lifestyle for their families. We love this area for
                                those seeking a lifestyle and investment purchase in Istanbul.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                Why is this area a suitable investment? As we mentioned earlier, Istanbul went from
                                around 3 million residents in the 1960s to around 20 million by 2020. Housing was
                                quickly erected to accommodate the growing numbers. With judicial reforms and safety
                                inspections being conducted in recent years, these areas are experiencing mass
                                regeneration.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                These new developments offer low prices for otherwise highly-priced properties due to
                                most homeowners having lived in the area for at least ten years or more. Easy access to
                                services, schools, and hospitals continues to drive prices in the area. Additionally, as
                                traffic continues to wreak havoc on residents, more and more are looking to set up in
                                easily commutable areas. These areas have too many positives to list.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                To conclude, we should note that entry-level prices are higher than in other areas. This
                                is particularly true with luxury-high-rise buildings in this location, as branding and
                                luxury are delivered to the highest level. While the base level price may put some
                                investors off, this is a fantastic location for those looking for a hands-off approach
                                to investing. Nightly, weekly, and monthly opportunities present themselves in this area
                                for those looking to capture a piece of the tourism pie.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                Demographics? Typically, this area boasts a younger and more educated population. The
                                area locals usually work in white-collar positions allowing them to have the expendable
                                income to purchase such properties. However, areas of Beyoglu, Fatih, Kadikoy, Sisli,
                                and Uskudar have large swaths of low-income areas. This is mainly due to a lack of
                                planning for new developments being allowed in these areas, plus these areas are near
                                the service industry sectors that support Istanbul’s millions of visitors annually.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                However, we expect this to change in the coming years as the municipality government
                                looks to “clean“ up the area and instill a new version of Istanbul.
                            </p>
                            <p class="px-4 mb-0 py-1 text-justify">
                                Many in the local government wish to see the restoration and recreation of Istanbul in a
                                modern form. We are getting there, which is why foreign investment continues to rise.
                                History is being written in front of us. Where do you want to be when the story is
                                written?

                                This part of Istanbul is often an unknown and scary area for foreigners and tourists
                                alike. As the American expression goes, <b>“you are often afraid of what you don’t
                                    know.”</b>
                                This is very true for the Eastern part of Istanbul. This area has some of Istanbul’s
                                cleanest and most family-oriented coastline neighborhoods in Istanbul. Yet many
                                foreigners have never ventured as far to find out for themselves. Though this is slowly
                                starting to change, it is still a very “Turkish“ area.
