                                differs between a 0.1% and 0.6% rate depending on where you own the property and the
                                type of property. For example, if you own an apartment in Istanbul, you will be subject
                                to the higher city tax of .2% calculated by the value of the property. The value is
                                calculated based on nominal value and is calculated by the local council. The nominal
                                value is usually less than the market value.

                                Property tax returns are filed every four years. This tax is calculated based on the
                                property’s facilities and the size of the plot in square meters. The rates are doubled
                                for a property in major urban areas such as Istanbul. Property tax is paid directly to
                                local municipalities (belediye) in two installments each year. The first installment is
                                due between March and May while the second one is due in November although it can be
                                paid in a lump sum with the first payment. Payment can be made at banks, by check,
                                online, or in cash at the local municipality.

                                Upon sale of property, owners are legally required to pay a property transfer tax, which
                                is paid on the basis of the actual sale or purchase price of the property. The sum of
                                approximately 1.5 percent of the value of the real estate needs to be paid by both
                                parties on registration of the transaction at the Land Registry. Prime Property Turkey

                                Income is levied on all owners in Turkey. It is levied from the home earnings. Rental
                                income can be determined by either the actual deduction method or the lump sum method.
                                The actual deduction method is when expenses including water expenses, lighting,
                                insurance, and depreciation cost from the rental income are deducted. Under the lump-sum
                                method, taxpayers deduct 25% of their gross income to arrive at a taxable income.

                                This is what you pay for an asset’s appreciation during the time you owned it. In
                                Turkey, the capital gain tax is paid when you sell your house within the first 5 years
                                of purchase and if you sell it 5 years after purchase, you are exempted from paying it.
                                This amount is calculated as a percentage of the profit you make between the stated
                                value of your property when you first bought it and the sale price you declare at the
